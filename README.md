# MM-008428-demovideo

We appreciate the comment from the reviewer. The video shows examples of saliency maps, which is generated using the original saliency model, i.e. SGSP, GD, MC, CVS and RWRV, and the corresponding improved version including SGSP*, GD*, MC*, CVS* and RWRV*. According to the results, it can be seen that the improved model performs better than its corresponding original model on these challenging videos. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework.
